Today I finished reading [The Richest Man in Babylon](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Richest_Man_in_Babylon/5MeNDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0). The language is entertaining, such as "set thy purse to fattening," which is one main idea of the book: set aside at least one-tenth of every paycheck, and your wealth will grow.
